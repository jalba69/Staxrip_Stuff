This version is for those who managed to have a Gifski.exe version with **built in FFMPEG + Avisynth support**.

This version works the same as the other for the installation and the rest but by default it doesn't extract the png's before creating the GiF, the .avs script from Staxrip is used to feed Gifski directly.

There is still an option to extract the png's if you want to.

Of course by eliminating the step to get the png's this version becomes way faster.

Enjoy  ;)
